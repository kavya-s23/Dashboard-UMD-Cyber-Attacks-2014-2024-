# Dashboard---UMD-Cyber-Attacks-2014-2024-
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard using cyber-attack data from 2014–2024 to analyze global trends and patterns. Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas) before importing the refined dataset into Power BI. The dashboard visualizes key insights such as top affected countries, industries, and attack types through dynamic charts and KPIs. Applied data transformation and DAX measures to build an intuitive, filter-enabled analytical dashboard, enabling seamless data exploration. This project delivers data-driven insights into global cybersecurity trends over the past decade, offering a comprehensive view of attack patterns and impacts.
